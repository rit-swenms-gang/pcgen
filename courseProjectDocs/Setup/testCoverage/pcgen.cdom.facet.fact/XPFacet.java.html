 * XP Facet is a facet that tracks the Experience Points of a Player Character.
 * 
 * Earned Experience Points are Experience Points that the Player Character has
 * earned through play.
 * 
 * Level-Adjusted Experience Points are Experience Points that the Player
 * Character has received through level adjustments, and are independent of
 * earned Experience Points.
 * 
 * Total Experience Points are a combination of Earned Experience Points and
 * Level-Adjusted Experience Points.
