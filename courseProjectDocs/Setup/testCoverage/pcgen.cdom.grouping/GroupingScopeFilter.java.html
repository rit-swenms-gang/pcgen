/**
 * A GroupingScopeFilter decorates a GroupingCollection in order to filter out objects
 * based on their scope.
 * 
 * As context: In general, the grouping objects returned when analyzing something like
 * GROUP=x are naive to their surroundings. They simply check for a GROUP= or a key, they
 * do not check that that actual object they are checking is the correct type of object
 * (Race, Skill, whatever). This could, of course, produce some nasty false positives.
 * This filter enforces that larger contract (ensuring the appropriate scope) so that
 * combined with the underlying GroupingCollection, one has both objects limited to a
 * specific scope (the first argument of MODIFYOTHER, as enforced by this filter) as well
 * as those that meet the appropriate grouping (the second argument of MODIFYOTHER, as
 * enforced by the underlying GroupingCollection).
 *
 * @param &lt;T&gt;
 *            The class of the object being stored in this GroupingScopeFilter
