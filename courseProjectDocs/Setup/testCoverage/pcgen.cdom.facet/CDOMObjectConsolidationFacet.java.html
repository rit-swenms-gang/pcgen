/**
 * CDOMObjectConsolidationFacet consolidates all of the CDOMObjects that are
 * added to a Player Character. By consolidating all of the CDOMObjects into one
 * location, behaviors which are consistent across all CDOMObjects can be
 * performed based on events from a single source Facet.
 * 
 * Note: If you attempt to use this class and receive an error that you have
 * created a cycle in the Spring graph of objects, you may use
 * CDOMObjectSourceFacet as the source of events instead of this Facet. This
 * will cause the receiving object to receive the same events, but will not
 * cause a cycle. This is possible because the underlying data store for the two
 * facets is the same.
